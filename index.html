                David's passion for life was evident in everything he did. Whether it was sharing a joke that had us all in
                stitches or providing a caring ear during tough times, he approached each moment with compassion and empathy.
                His memory will forever remain a source of strength and warmth for those who had the privilege of knowing
                him. As we bid farewell to David, we are left with a profound sense of loss, yet we take comfort in the
                countless cherished moments and memories we shared. He leaves behind a legacy of love, laughter, and
                indelible wisdom that will continue to guide us through the days ahead. Rest in peace, dear friend. Your
                spirit will live on in our hearts, and you will be deeply missed. ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
                <br>from his friend, S.
                <br>
